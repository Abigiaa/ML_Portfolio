## Program 1

This program will do data exploration with statistical  functions on boston.csv file with C++.

You can see the [code here](Program_1.cpp) and a [descriptive document here](boston_document.pdf)


### Program 2.1

This program will do a linear regression.

You can see the [Rmd file here](regression.Rmd) and the [Rmd-print-to-pdf here](regression.pdf)


### Program 2.2

This program will do a logistic regression and naive Bayes.

You can see the [Rmd file here](Classification.Rmd)

#### Program 3

This program will do a logistic regression and naive Bayes using C++ on titanic data.

You can see the logistic regression [code here](LogisticRegression.cpp) and the Naive Bayes [code here](NaiveBayes.cpp)

You can see the [report document here](Report.pdf)

##### Program 4

This program did the similarity models Regression,Classification,Clustering and PCA_LDA on a datasets.

You can see the Rmd print-to-pdfs for Regression [here](RegressionNotebook.pdf), for Classification [here](ClassificationNotebook.pdf)

for PCA_LDA [here](PCA_LDA.pdf), for Clustering [here](ClusteringNotebook.pdf), and the narrative document [here](Searching_For_Similarity.pdf)
